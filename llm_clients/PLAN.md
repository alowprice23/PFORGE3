# PLAN: `llm_clients/` Directory

## Chunk 2 - Basic LLM Client [x]

**Goal**: Implement a basic, functional LLM client that agents can use to generate code.

**Status**: Completed.

## Chunk 3 - No Changes [x]

**Goal**: The focus for Chunk 3 is on the agent workflow and local-only execution. The existing LLM client implementation is sufficient.

**File-by-File Plan**:

*   No changes are planned for any files in the `llm_clients/` directory during this chunk.

---

*This plan is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves.*
