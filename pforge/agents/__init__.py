"""
The Agents package contains the concrete implementations of all specialized,
autonomous agents that constitute the pForge system.

Each agent is a distinct, modular service responsible for executing a
specific part of the overall puzzle-solving workflow.

Modules:
- base_agent: The abstract base class for all agents.
- observer_agent: The primary sensor, building the evidence graph.
- spec_oracle_agent: The arbiter of correctness, evaluating specification
  constraints (Î¦).
- ... and many more agents for planning, fixing, etc.
